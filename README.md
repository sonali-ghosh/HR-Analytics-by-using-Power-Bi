# HR-Analytics-by-using-Power-Bi
In this project, I used Power BI to dive into HR data, analyzing various aspects to provide insights and support decision-making. Here's a breakdown of what I did:
Employee Attrition Analysis,Performance Metrics Visualization,Diversity and Inclusion Metrics,Training and Development Impact,Recruitment Analytics.
Absolutely! One challenge I faced was dealing with incomplete data regarding employee engagement. To address this, I implemented a data imputation strategy in Power BI, filling in missing values using averages and trends. This ensured that the analysis remained comprehensive and provided valuable insights despite the data gaps.
The analysis played a crucial role in supporting HR decision-making. It provided actionable insights for talent retention, performance improvement, and diversity initiatives. The Power BI dashboards facilitated easy communication of complex HR data trends to stakeholders, enabling informed decisions that positively impacted employee satisfaction and overall organizational performance.
